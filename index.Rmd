I am an adjunct professor at the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Methods at Pozna≈Ñ University of Life Sciences [Department of Mathematical and Statistical Methods](http://merlin.up.poznan.pl/kmmis2/).

In my daily research activities, I focuse mainly on the development and application of various statistical methods to data from microarrays, next-generation sequencing experiments (NGS) and single-cell. I'm interested in a wide range of issues related to biostatistics.
