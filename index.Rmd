I am an Assistant Staff Biostatistician at the Cleveland Clinic in the [Department of Quantitative Health Sciences](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/qhs/zabor/), with a joint appointment in the Taussig Cancer Institute. I also hold an academic appointment as Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. 

My research interests are in clinical trial design and statistical methods for observational studies, with applications to oncology.

I earned my MS in biostatistics in 2010 from The University of Minnesota and my DrPH in biostatistics in 2019 from Columbia University.  

I am an avid R enthusiast and an active member of [R Ladies](https://rladies.org/).
