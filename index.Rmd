I am an adjunct professor at the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Methods at Pozna≈Ñ University of Life Sciences [Department of Mathematical and Statistical Methods](http://merlin.up.poznan.pl/kmmis2/).

In my research activities, I concentrate on the development and application of statistical methods to data from microarrays, next-generation sequencing experiments (NGS) and single-cell. My research interests extend to a wide range of issues related to biostatistics.
